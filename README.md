# The Hidden Corridor
## Project 2 - Part of Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp

### Description
The Hidden Corridor is a secret place within the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft Wizardry, where students have been posting illicit potions for generations. You will be able to create a Wizard User and after finding the hidden link to the entrance of the Hidden Corridor, create or edit your own recipe as well as liking other wizards recipes. The more likes your recipe gets, the more points for your house. Check the points in the Trophy Room!
